# phonebook-backend
Backend portion for the phonebook app

This repo contains the backend portion of my [phonebook app](https://github.com/enrique-cardenas/phonebook), and the frontend production build of it as well.

The data is persisted using MongoDB and hosted using MongoDB Atlas.

A live demo of the project can be found [here](https://floating-lowlands-89966.herokuapp.com/).
